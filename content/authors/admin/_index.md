I am a recent Ph.D. graduate from the Operations Research Center, MIT, where I was advised by Prof. Vivek Farias. My research has been focused on two themes:
a) Use of machine learning in healthcare operations
b) Optimization for online platforms.

More recently, I have also worked on understanding the impact of government policies on agricultural lending in developing countries.

Prior to MIT, I worked at Deutsche Bank as a quantitative analyst in the Equity Trading team. Here I focussed on building unwinding and hedging strategies for European cash markets. I have also interned at research teams in several companies including Facebook, Target, Xerox and IBM.

I completed my Bachelor's and Master in Technology in Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay, where I was advised by Prof. Abhay Karandikar and Prof. V. Kavitha.
