abstract = "The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has proposed the concept of heteroge- neous cellular networks to meet the increasing demands of cellular users. These networks consist of small cells like micro, pico and femto cell in addition to the already existing macro cell. The small cells achieve an increase in system capacity by installation of base stations close to the user location. Another major benefit that small cells are expected to bring is improvement in energy efficiency. Proximity of the base station with the user equipment implies lesser power requirement for transmitting information between the two. However, installing a large number of new base stations for the small cells can also lead to an increase in the total energy consumption of the system. Thus, novel approaches for saving energy are required in heterogeneous networks. One of the mechanisms that have been proposed towards this is switching OFF these base stations at times of low load. These mechanisms make use of the variability in the total user demand at different times of the day. In this work, we consider a heterogeneous network with a macrocell overlaying an area in which pico base stations have also been installed. At times of low load, the pico base stations can be switched OFF to save energy. We study the optimal switch OFF policies for pico base stations. For any given traffic conditions, we determine the maximum fraction of base stations that can be switched OFF while maintaining quality of service (in terms of the average waiting time). Using tools of Multimodularity, we determine the optimal ON-OFF policy for each base station and the optimal association policy between users and base stations. In the second part of the work, we consider a stand-alone pico base station and focus on its ON-OFF switching depending on the number of users in the coverage region. We find the optimal policy which minimizes a sum of two costs - cost due to power consumption of base station and cost associated with user's Quality of Service."
