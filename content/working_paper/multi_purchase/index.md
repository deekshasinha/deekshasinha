abstract = "We study the problem of modeling purchase of multiple items and utilizing it to display optimized recommendations, which is a central problem for online e-commerce platforms.  Rich personalized modeling of users and fast computation of optimal products to display given these models can significantly enhance the end user experience on the platform and simultaneously lead to higher revenues.  We present a parsimonious multi-product family of choice models called the BundleMVL-K family, and develop a binary search based iterative strategy that efficiently computes optimized recommendations for this model. We characterize structural properties of the optimal solution and the computational hardness of the problem. Results: We show the efficacy of both our modeling and optimization techniques compared to competing solutions using several real world datasets on multiple metrics relating to model fitness, run-time and expected revenue. The simplicity of our multi-purchase model and the iterative nature of our optimization technique allows decision makers and practitioners meet stringent statistical and computational constraints in practical recommendation applications at scale, especially in e-commerce platforms and other marketplaces."
